### How to add it to your repo right now:
1. In VS Code, create a new file in your project folder called exactly `LICENSE` (no extension).
2. Paste the entire text above into it (including the top `# LICENSE` heading if you want, but it's optional — GitHub recognizes it either way).
3. Replace `[Your Full Name or Username]` with your actual name/handle (e.g., `Copyright (c) 2025 John Doe` or `Copyright (c) 2025 @yourusername`).
4. Save it.
5. In terminal:
   ```bash
   git add LICENSE
   git commit -m "Add MIT License"
   git push
   ```

GitHub will automatically detect and display the MIT license badge on your repo page within seconds.

Done — your repo is now properly licensed and looks professional! 🚀
